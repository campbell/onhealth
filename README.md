I probably went a bit beyond what was needed for this exercise, but it was a great opportunity
to try some metaprogramming and use some functional programming...so if it seems a bit much...sorry!
The specs mentioned that pitching stats will be added in the future, so I figured it was okay to
make the problem more interesting and add some nice features to make stats easier to find, 
manipulate, etc.

The commit messages are basically useless. Since this was a coding exercise, I didn't worry about 
describing what I was doing in each commit, much less making a commit for each significant refactoring step along the way.
