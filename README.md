I probably went a bit beyond what was needed for this exercise, but it was a great opportunity
to try some metaprogramming and use some functional programming...so if it seems a bit much...sorry!
The specs mentioned that pitching stats will be added in the future, so I figured it was okay to
make the problem more interesting and add some nice features to make stats easier to find, 
manipulate, etc.
